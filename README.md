# üß¨ Drug Response Predictor

This project applies supervised machine learning models to classify patient responses to various drug treatments.  
It uses Decision Trees, Random Forests, and visualization tools to explore and evaluate model performance.

‚ú® Why I Made This
This project was created to demonstrate my hands-on ability to build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model in a biomedical context ‚Äî including tasks often required for junior data science roles in healthcare, bioinformatics, or scientific computing.

It reflects essential capabilities such as:

Writing Python code for data pipelines and model workflows

Using ML frameworks like Scikit-Learn and Pandas

Interpreting clinical-style datasets with numeric and categorical features

Evaluating accuracy and visualizing prediction outputs

Delivering reproducible, annotated Colab notebooks that communicate the work clearly


## üîç Key Features
- Built with Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- Trains and compares multiple classification models
- Designed for healthcare and bioinformatics applications


# üß™ Drug Response Predictor

This notebook builds a machine learning model to predict drug response based on features in a biomedical dataset. It walks through:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Label encoding of categorical features
- Model training using Random Forest
- Accuracy evaluation and confusion matrix analysis

Useful for bioinformatics, ML beginners, and healthcare AI workflows.

## üîç Feature Importance Visualization

This notebook demonstrates how a trained Random Forest model identifies which input features (such as Age, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol) are most influential in predicting drug response. The output includes a colorful, intuitive bar chart for model interpretability and explanation.
